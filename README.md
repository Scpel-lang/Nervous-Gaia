# Nervous-0.0.1-Gaia
Amongst the many types of kernels and research areas:
	1) Monolithic kernels
	2) Micro kernels
	3) Hybrid kernels
	4) Nano kernels
	5) Exokernels and more...
The concept of [Neural Kernels](https://www.scpel.org/neural_kernels.html) unlike 
[Neural Tangent Kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tangent_kernel) that 
describes the evolution of deep artificial neural networks during their training with
gradient descent, Neural kernels lie amongst the many types of Operating system kernels
that for the core layer of an OS. With Neural Kernels, design and behaviour is rather
expected to mimic that of a biological nervous system implemented in code with a
programming language Scpel thereby having a single piece of software able to run on almost
every supportive automated hardware with reflective capabilities.
