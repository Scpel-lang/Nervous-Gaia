# Nervous-0.0.1-Gaia
Based on a Neural kernel architecture, researched, inspired and coined by Francis Ssessaazi. Nervous is an artificial system kernel that serves to effectively 
support super intelligence in a sense that the kernel itself is the AI but stronger,
faster and more intelligent proportionally equivalent to a human mind!.

# Description
Amongst the many types of kernels and research areas:
[Monolithic kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel)
[Micro kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel)
[Hybrid kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_kernel)
[Exokernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exokernel) and more...
The concept of [Neural Kernels](https://www.scpel.org/neural_kernels.html) unlike 
[Neural Tangent Kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_tangent_kernel) that 
describes the evolution of deep artificial neural networks during their training,
Neural kernels lie amongst the many types of Operating system kernels
that serves as the core layer of an OS. With Neural Kernels, design and behaviour is
rather expected to mimic that of a biological nervous system implemented in code.

# Note to developers and enthusiasts
This specific version of Nervous is based on Linux kernel 6.1.4 (a monolithic kernel)
therefore the same build process and structure is expected. However please note that
Nervous hasn't yet met its intended purpose of being a multi-arch kernel so only expect
an x86 architecture on this specific build that will create binaries that will run
intelligently on your x86_64 Hardware.

NOTE:
	Nervous is made possible by Scpel, a programming language designed specifically
	for this type of task and so yes, you need to build with a Scpel compiler.
